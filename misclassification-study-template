# Misclassification Case Study — TEMPLATE
Version: 1.0  
Status: Template (for reuse)  
Applies to: Cognition Scale Taxonomy (LCM / LLM / MCM / SCM)

---

## 1. Case Summary (1–3 sentences)
A concise explanation of the misclassification incident.

**Example format:**
A major tech provider marketed an LLM-powered tool as “agentic AI.”  
The system’s architecture reveals no autonomous cognition or deterministic agency.

---

## 2. Source (public-facing)
Provide a screenshot, link, or citation:

- Platform:
- Publisher:
- Date observed:
- Asset(s):

*(Images may be stored in `case_studies/assets/` with filename referenced here.)*

---

## 3. Claim Made by the Source
Quote or restate the public claim exactly as presented.

**Example:**
> “Master Agentic AI with expert training from [Company].”

---

## 4. Taxonomy Classification (Correct)
Identify the *actual* cognition class based on the Cognition Scale.

- **Correct Class:** LLM / SCM / MCM / LCM  
- **Reason:** (1–2 sentences)

---

## 5. Misclassification Type  
Choose one or more:

- **Upward Anthropomorphic Drift** (LLM → implied proto-agency/persona)  
- **Capability Inflation**  
- **Taxonomy Boundary Confusion**  
- **Marketing-Induced Class Shift**  
- **Agent-Frame Misuse**  
- **Ambiguous Terminology**  
- **Composite Architecture Mislabeling**  

---

## 6. Architecture Inspection
Describe the system’s likely or published architecture and where the misclassification arises.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Stochastic LLM core  
- [ ] No deterministic overseer (MCM)  
- [ ] No explicit memory  
- [ ] No skill gating  
- [ ] No policy engine  
- [ ] No refusal behavior  
- [ ] No audit chain  
- [ ] Marketing suggests agency without architectural basis  

---

## 7. Impact Assessment  
What confusion or harm can arise from this misclassification?

- Public misunderstanding  
- Policy misalignment  
- Overstated capabilities  
- Expectation mismatch  
- Unsafe deployment framing  
- Researchers adopting incorrect vocabulary  

---

## 8. Corrective Framing  
Provide the proper, taxonomy-aligned description.

**Example:**
“This is an LLM-based tool augmented with retrieval, not an agentic cognition system.”

---

## 9. Alignment to Cognition Scale  
How this case reinforces taxonomy boundaries.

- Shows necessity of strict class definitions  
- Demonstrates real-world confusion  
- Highlights gap between marketing vs architecture  
- Validates need for deterministic MCM layer

## 10. Notes for Future Reviewers  
Space for comments, expansions, or follow-up action.
