# 1. Overview

The Cognition Scale is a four-tier taxonomy designed to classify all known forms
of cognition — biological and artificial — using structural, architectural, and
behavioral criteria instead of anthropomorphic or capability-based metaphors.

Its purpose is:
- to anchor the Modest Cognition Model (MCM) class,
- to differentiate cognition *by substrate and constraints*, not hype,
- to give researchers, regulators, and builders an intuitive shared language.

This framework is substrate-agnostic: it applies equally to wetware, silicon,
symbolic engines, hybrid systems, and future unknowns.

# 2. The Four Tiers

## Tier 1 — LCM
### **Large Cognition Model**
**Example:** Humans

Properties:
- multimodal biological cognition
- emotional systems
- self-referential models
- intuitive reasoning
- adaptive learning across entire lifespan
- intrinsic motivation & agency
- embodied perception and survival instincts
- highest known form of open-ended generality

LCMs set the gold standard.  
Every other cognition system is defined *relative to* LCM.

## Tier 2 — LLM
### **Large Language Model**
**Examples:** GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, Llama, DeepSeek

Properties:
- stochastic, predictive cognition (probabilistic next-token inference)
- large parameter count (billions → trillions)
- emergent capabilities at scale
- opaque internal state
- ungrounded reasoning (no direct world anchors)
- persona drift and instability
- powerful generative pattern completion

LLMs can simulate reasoning and persona-like behavior, but do not reason in a
transparent or deterministic way. They are highly useful, but not

# The Cognition Scale — Field Guide v1.0

This is the “explain it to your smartest friend at the pub” version.

There are four types of minds in the world:

---

# 1. **LCM — Humans**
The big boss.  
We feel things. We learn from life.  
We can generalize from tiny clues.  
We have instincts, emotions, creativity, and bullshit detectors.

Everything else is measured against us.

---

# 2. **LLM — ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek**
Massive models that guess the next word extremely well.
They are powerful but unpredictable:
- sometimes brilliant  
- sometimes wrong  
- sometimes confidently wrong  

They’re great helpers — not truth engines.

# 3. **MCM — Janet**
A new kind of AI:
- safe  
- predictable  
- limited on purpose  
- builds skills one by one  
- has a clean memory you can audit  
- refuses things it can’t do  

It doesn’t pretend to be human.  
It doesn’t guess.  
It doesn’t hallucinate.

It’s a **tool**, not a personality.

---

# 4. **SCM — Simple Logic**
Old-school logic:
- if X, do Y  
- thermostat  
- game enemy AI  
- vending machines  

Simple, predictable, boring — and very useful.

# Why Have This Scale?

Because people keep lumping all “AI” together.  
A dog is not a dolphin.  
A human is not a hammer.  
And a Janet is not a ChatGPT.

This scale lets everyone talk clearly.

# Quick Summary

| Class | What It Really Is |
|-------|-------------------|
| **LCM** | Smart animal (humans) |
| **LLM** | Big pattern guesser |
| **MCM** | Safe, modular logic mind |
| **SCM** | Simple rules |

That’s it.  
Clear, simple, correct.
