📎 Appendix C — Real-World Misclassification Case Study (Industry “Agentic AI”)

Version: 2025-12-01
Repository: Cognition Scale Taxonomy (v0.3 → v0.4 bridge)
Purpose: Demonstrate category drift and misclassification in current AI industry marketing

C.1 Overview

Modern AI marketing frequently presents large language models (LLMs) as “agents,” implying autonomy, goal-directed behavior, or cognitive capability beyond what LLMs can reliably provide.

This appendix documents a real, widely distributed example of such misclassification and contrasts it with correct taxonomy usage.

C.2 Example: Coursera/IBM Advertisement (2025)

A publicly circulated Coursera + IBM advertisement for an “Agentic AI Professional Certificate” (2025) claims:

> “Use AI tools to streamline automation with the IBM RAG and Agentic AI Professional Certificate.
Build in-demand skills in generative AI, agentic systems, and more.”



This ad uses “agentic AI” to refer to:

LLMs with RAG wrappers

LLMs orchestrating tool-use flows

Vector database retrieval

Classical automation packaged as “agents”


No deterministic reasoning layer is included. No explicit memory. No safety guarantees. No policy enforcement.

This is not agentic cognition under this taxonomy.


---

C.3 Classification Under the Cognition Scale

The system advertised is classified as:

LLM: stochastic, token-predictive substrate

+ SCM components: scripted tool calls and RAG pipelines

Faux-MCM: misrepresented as an agentic or cognitive decision layer


This system does not qualify as an MCM under any condition because it lacks:

1. Determinism


2. Traceability


3. Explicit memory


4. Curriculum gating


5. Refusal behavior


6. Stable identity


7. Safety spine


8. Transparent state


9. Policy-controlled tool access


10. Human override and rollback



Failing any one of these disqualifies it from MCM classification.
It fails all ten.

C.4 Why This Misclassification Is Dangerous

Mislabeling LLM tool pipelines as “agents” causes:

1. Upward Anthropomorphic Drift

LLMs are framed as autonomous decision-makers instead of stochastic text engines.

2. Policy Confusion

Regulators are misled about system capability, risk, and oversight requirements.

3. Public Misunderstanding

Non-experts assume independence, goals, or intent where none exists.

4. Engineering Misdesign

Developers build systems on false assumptions (e.g., “the agent will reason about errors”).

5. Safety Failure Vectors

Faux-MCMs bypass guardrails through hidden RAG state, unlogged reasoning, and unpredictable tool calls.

C.5 Correct Classification (What Agentic AI Actually Means)

Under the Cognition Scale:

Agentic cognition requires:

Deterministic reasoning

Transparent, queryable state

Explicit memory

Skill manifests with hard gating

Policy enforcement layers

Refusal/caution behavior

Clear substrate boundaries

Human override

No hallucinations

No persona drift

Traceable chain-of-thought (non-internal, non-sensitive)


This is the Modest Cognition Model (MCM) class.

LLMs can participate in agentic architectures only as:

proposal generators

suggestion engines

idea expanders


never as the governing layer.


---

C.6 Why This Case Study Is Included

To give researchers, policymakers, educators, and the public a concrete example of:

Industry terminology drift

Faux-agency framing

Boundary erosion

How real-world systems differ from MCM definitions


This taxonomy is intentionally conservative to prevent exactly this kind of conflation.

C.7 Summary Table

Attribute	IBM/Coursera “Agentic AI”	Cognition Scale Agentic (MCM)

Substrate	LLM + RAG	Deterministic reasoning core
Memory	Implicit embeddings	Explicit tables / logs
Determinism	No	Yes
Hallucination Risk	High	None
Policy Enforcement	Minimal	Mandatory
Tool Use	LLM-driven	MCM-validated
Refusal Behavior	Weak	Strong
UX Framing	Anthropomorphic	Non-anthropomorphic
Correct Classification	LLM/SCM Hybrid	MCM



---

C.8 Conclusion

This advertisement exemplifies the industry’s recurring error:
equating stochastic LLM behavior with agentic cognition.

The Cognition Scale prevents this confusion by:

enforcing strict class boundaries

banning upward anthropomorphic drift

defining MCMs as deterministic, bounded, safe cognitive engines

reserving LLMs for stochastic proposal generation


This case study should serve as a reference point for future audits, grants, and public communication.
