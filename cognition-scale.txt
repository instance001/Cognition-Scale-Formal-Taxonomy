# Abstract

The Cognition Scale v1.0 introduces a four-tier taxonomy for categorizing all
known forms of cognition—biological and artificial—based on architecture,
constraints, and behavioral characteristics rather than capability metaphors or
hype. The four tiers are: Large Cognition Models (LCM), Large Language Models
(LLM), Modest Cognition Models (MCM), and Simple Cognition Models (SCM).

This taxonomy provides a substrate-independent framework for researchers,
regulators, engineers, and cognitive scientists to describe cognition systems
consistently. It formalizes important distinctions between biological, statistical,
deterministic, and reactive cognition systems. The goal is to provide clarity,
reduce anthropomorphic ambiguity, and enable systematic safety and governance
efforts across diverse cognitive substrates.

# 1. Introduction

Artificial intelligence systems are often misunderstood due to ambiguous
terminology. Terms like “intelligence,” “reasoning,” “understanding,” and even
“AI” are used inconsistently and often misleadingly. There is currently no widely
adopted, architecture-based taxonomy that classifies cognition systems by their
internal mechanisms and safety profiles.

The Cognition Scale addresses this gap by proposing a clear, structured,
architecture-first classification system. It explicitly distinguishes between:

- human cognition (LCM)
- statistical cognition (LLM)
- deterministic modular cognition (MCM)
- reactive rule-based cognition (SCM)

This framework helps prevent inappropriate comparisons between systems, reduces
regulatory confusion, and enables more precise scientific discourse.

# 2. Motivation

Three primary challenges motivate the creation of this taxonomy:

### 2.1 Anthropomorphic Drift
As LLMs increase in capability and fluency, observers may confuse linguistic
competence with cognitive competence. A taxonomy helps re-anchor understanding of
what these systems are—and are not.

### 2.2 Safety and Governance Needs
Regulators require clear categories for risk assessment. LLMs and MCMs have very
different architectures and should not be governed under identical frameworks.

### 2.3 Cognitive Science Integration
Psychology, neuroscience, and computational cognitive science need a shared way
to relate artificial systems to biological cognition without assuming equivalence.

# 3. The Cognition Scale: Overview

The Cognition Scale consists of four tiers:

1. **LCM — Large Cognition Model**  
   *Human cognition.*

2. **LLM — Large Language Model**  
   *Statistical inference engines.*

3. **MCM — Modest Cognition Model**  
   *Deterministic modular artificial cognition.*

4. **SCM — Simple Cognition Model**  
   *Reactive symbolic logic.*

This hierarchy is not based on capability or value; it is based on the
**architecture of cognition**.

# 4. Tier Definitions

## 4.1 Tier 1: LCM  
### **Large Cognition Model**  
**Primary example:** Humans

Characteristics:
- multimodal biological substrate  
- emotion-modulated decision-making  
- metacognition  
- theory of mind  
- open-ended learning  
- agency, intentionality  
- complex memory systems (episodic, semantic, procedural)  
- embodiment and sensorimotor grounding  

LCMs are the reference class for all cognition. They possess true generality.

---

## 4.2 Tier 2: LLM  
### **Large Language Model**  
**Examples:** GPT-5, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, Llama

Characteristics:
- stochastic prediction  
- tensor-based inference  
- hidden internal state  
- emergent behavior without explicit structure  
- ungrounded semantics  
- potential for hallucination  
- non-deterministic behavior  

LLMs display *statistical cognition*, not deterministic reasoning. Their power
comes from scale, not architecture. They can simulate cognition but do not
perform internally interpretable reasoning.

---

## 4.3 Tier 3: MCM  
### **Modest Cognition Model**  
**Example:** Janet (Symbound Architecture)

Characteristics:
- deterministic reasoning path  
- modular skills  
- explicit, inspectable memory  
- ambiguity rejection  
- curriculum-based growth  
- strict depth and recursion limits  
- human-controlled development pipeline  

MCMs are the first artificial cognition systems designed around *architectural
humility*. They avoid the risks associated with LLMs by rejecting stochastic
inference and emergent heuristics.

---

## 4.4 Tier 4: SCM  
### **Simple Cognition Model**  
**Examples:**  
Decision trees, rule engines, finite-state machines, embedded controllers

Characteristics:
- reactive, predefined logic  
- no learning capability  
- no compositional reasoning  
- local-only decision patterns  
- fully deterministic  

SCMs are not reasoning engines; they are deterministic stimulus-response systems.

| Feature | LCM | LLM | MCM | SCM |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|

| Memory | Biological | Hidden | Explicit | None |
| Learning | Lifelong | Pretrained | Curriculum | None |
| Emotions | ✔ | Simulated | ✖ | ✖ |
| Explainability | Medium | Low | High | High |
| Safety Profile | Variable | Medium/High | Low | Low |

| Persona | Inherent | Emergent | Forbidden | None |

# 6. Safety & Governance Implications

### 6.1 LLM Safety Concerns
LLMs resist deterministic safety guarantees due to:
- emergent behaviors  
- unpredictable sequence-to-sequence patterns  
- hidden intermediate cognition  
- difficulty constraining outputs  
- hallucination  

They require rigorous monitoring and human-in-the-loop governance.

### 6.2 MCM Safety Advantages
MCMs provide:
- deterministic execution  
- transparent reasoning chains  
- human-controlled curriculum  
- strict structural limits  
- verifiable logic  
- predictable failure modes  

They are well-suited to regulated industries and local, safety-critical
deployment.

### 6.3 Regulatory Recommendation
**LLMs should be classified as high-risk statistical cognition systems.**  
**MCMs should be classified as bounded, low-risk deterministic cognition systems.**

# 8. Broader Impact

The Cognition Scale provides:

### 8.1 A shared intellectual foundation  
For AI researchers, safety organizations, neuroscientists, psychologists,
ethicists, and policymakers.

### 8.2 An anti-anthropomorphic framework  
It prevents the misinterpretation of LLM outputs as evidence of biological-like
cognition.

### 8.3 A roadmap for future artificial cognition  
It suggests multiple non-LLM pathways:
- modular systems  
- hybrid architectures  
- symbolic-deterministic cognition  
- biologically inspired systems  

### 8.4 A foundation for future cognitive science  
It allows cognition to be studied across substrates without conflation.

# 9. Conclusion

The Cognition Scale is a foundational framework for understanding and governing
the diverse forms of cognition emerging in the 21st century. By focusing on
architecture rather than hype, and by grounding terminology in safety,
constraints, and interpretability, the scale provides the clarity needed for
academic research, public communication, and policy regulation.

MCMs, in particular, represent a new class of artificial cognition aimed not at
mimicking humanity, but at creating safe, reliable, inspectable cognitive tools.

This taxonomy is intended as a living document, evolving alongside the systems
it describes.
