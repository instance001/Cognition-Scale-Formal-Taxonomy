# The Cognition Scale — Psychology & Biology Crossover Explainer (v1.0)
## Understanding Human, Statistical, Modular, and Reactive Cognition

This document explains the Cognition Scale through the lens of:
- cognitive psychology  
- neuroscience  
- ethology and evolutionary biology  
- computational cognitive science  

Its purpose is to help natural-science researchers map artificial cognition
onto familiar biological principles — without anthropomorphism.

# 1. Why a Cognition Scale?

In biology and psychology, cognition is studied in terms of:
- information processing  
- behavioral decision-making  
- learning mechanisms  
- memory systems  
- attention, perception, emotion  
- motivational states  

But artificial systems differ profoundly in:
- substrate  
- constraints  
- learning mechanisms  
- internal representation  
- interpretability  

The Cognition Scale creates a **bridge vocabulary** that respects both domains.

# 2. The Four Tiers Through a Scientific Lens

## Tier 1 — LCM (Large Cognition Model)
**Biological analogue:** Humans  
**Psychological features:**
- metacognition  
- theory of mind  
- emotion-modulated decision making  
- embodied sensorimotor integration  
- narrative memory  
- self-reference  

The LCM is *not* defined by capacity but by architectural *richness* and
biological grounding. It is the only class with intrinsic motivation.

## Tier 2 — LLM (Large Language Model)
**Biological analogue:** None  
(They are unlike brains, insects, or animals.)

**Closest psychological analogue:**  
Autocompletion of meaning with no grounding.

Properties:
- massive associative memory  
- pattern-completion cognition  
- “concepts” as statistical attractors  
- emergent behaviors without explicit structure  

They are not agents, not learners, and not reasoners — they are **statistical
phenomena that look like cognition**.

## Tier 3 — MCM (Modest Cognition Model)
**Biological analogue:**  
Modular nervous systems with strict circuit boundaries (e.g., cephalopods,
insect ganglia), *but only metaphorically.*

**Cognitive properties:**
- deterministic logic chains  
- explicit, inspectable memory  
- modular skills (like specialized neural circuits)  
- externally controlled learning via curriculum  
- strict limits on recursion, depth, and inference  

This architecture resembles a **designed nervous system**, not an evolved one:
- no emotions  
- no reinforcement loops  
- no unpredictable emergence  
- no hidden state  

It is a **tool cognition layer**, engineered for safety and legibility.

## Tier 4 — SCM (Simple Cognition Model)
**Biological analogue:**  
Reflex arcs, simple stimulus-response patterns.

**Cognitive properties:**
- no abstraction  
- no growth  
- no generalization  
- mechanistic execution  

SCMs are machine reflexes.

# 3. Why This Matters for Natural-Science Researchers

### 1. It enables substrate-independent cognition research.
You can compare:
- human reasoning  
- LLM statistical attractors  
- MCM deterministic modules  
- SCM reactive pathways  

…using one taxonomy.

### 2. It contextualizes artificial minds without anthropomorphism.
You don’t need to treat LLMs as “proto-minds” or “emotional mimicry engines.”  
You can classify them as **statistical cognition systems** — an entirely new category.

### 3. It clarifies what “intelligence” even means.
Different classes achieve problem-solving through *completely different mechanisms*.

### 4. It enables cross-disciplinary collaboration.
Psychologists, AI engineers, neuroscientists, cognitive scientists, and safety
researchers gain a shared operating vocabulary.

# 4. Where This Framework Fits in Cognitive Science

The Cognition Scale assists with:
- theory of intelligence  
- comparative cognition  
- computational modeling  
- AI interpretability  
- artificial metacognition research  
- boundaries of generality studies  

It supports a **pluralistic, multi-substrate view of cognition**, where:
- biological intelligence  
- statistical cognition  
- deterministic artificial cognition  
- reactive logic  

…are recognized as different *species* of mind-like systems.
