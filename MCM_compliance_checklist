Modest Cognition Model (MCM) — Compliance Checklist v1.0

Status: Normative, required for all MCM classifications
Author: Instance001 (Anthony)
License: AGPL-v3
Version: 2025-11-27 (baseline)

This checklist defines the mandatory requirements a system must satisfy to qualify as a Modest Cognition Model (MCM) under the Cognition Scale Taxonomy.

Failing ANY single category → automatic disqualification.
This prevents misclassification and maintains strict, auditable boundaries between MCMs, LLMs, and agent shells.


---

✅ 1. Deterministic Core

Required:

No randomness

No sampling

No stochastic influence on decision paths

Identical inputs ⇒ identical outputs

LLMs must remain outside the core


Fail conditions:

Any use of temperature, top-p, or sampling

“Deterministic mode” LLM calls inside the core logic

Hidden stochastic heuristics



---

✅ 2. Explicit Memory

Required:

JSON/SQL/state-table storage

No hidden or implicit memory

All writes logged

No silent data mutation

Reversible, inspectable state


Fail conditions:

Vector DBs used as memory

Learned embeddings as state

Weight updates used as “memory”

Any unlogged change



---

✅ 3. Human-Gated Skill Acquisition

Required:

Skills/tools defined via manifest

Explicit permissioning

No autonomous tool expansion

No self-learning


Fail conditions:

Auto-installing new tools

Model self-expansion

Autonomous routing to new capabilities



---

✅ 4. Safety & Refusal Behavior

Required:

System can say: “I don’t know”

Safe abstentions

Hedging permitted

No hallucinations

No bluffing


Fail conditions:

Forced answer behavior

Pattern-based hallucinations

Overconfident wrong answers



---

✅ 5. Policy Enforcement

Required:

Policy graph / ruleset

Every output passes enforcement

Versioned policies

No bypass paths


Fail conditions:

Tools or LLM calls bypass checks

Policy stored in weights

Unversioned rules



---

✅ 6. Explainability & Traceability

Required:

Deterministic explanations

Visible decision chain

Queryable logs

No “black box” regions


Fail conditions:

Non-deterministic reasoning traces

Opaque weight-space decisions

Missing logs



---

✅ 7. Boundary Integrity

Required:

No anthropomorphism

No persona drift

No LLM-like creativity

Deterministic tone stability


Fail conditions:

Suggesting emotions, wants, intent

UX that implies self-identity

Style drift



---

✅ 8. LLM Integration (If Applicable)

Required:

LLM = proposal generator ONLY

MCM validates all outputs

Logged calls

Hard refusal if unsafe


Fail conditions:

LLM decision paths

MCM deferring to LLM

Unlogged LLM calls

Tool routing via LLM



---

✅ 9. Curriculum Compliance (Janet-Specific)

Required:

Documented grade level

Tests required for promotion

No spontaneous generalization


Fail conditions:

Skipping grade gates

Gaining new reasoning patterns without human approval

Overgeneralization outside curriculum



---

✅ 10. Human Override

Required:

Hard stop

Rollback

Human-driven override

Clear degradation detection


Fail conditions:

Runaway loops

No emergency stop

No rollback path
