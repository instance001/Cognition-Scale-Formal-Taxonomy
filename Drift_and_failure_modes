Drift & Failure Modes Annex (v1.0)


This annex documents the systemic failure patterns that cause artificial systems to drift out of their intended cognition class under the Cognition Scale Taxonomy.


It applies to:




MCM implementers


LLM safety wrappers


Tool-using agents


Hybrid systems


Deterministic overseers


Janet-core curriculum implementations




Each failure mode here is class-corrupting — meaning any one of them can disqualify a system from its intended cognition class (especially MCM).



B.1 — Upward Anthropomorphic Drift


A system begins to present as a proto-person due to language, UX, or implicit cues.


Causes:




UX that suggests emotion, will, intent


Uncontrolled LLM phrasing


Marketing copy implying consciousness




Risks:




User confusion


Ethical boundary violations


Category slippage into LCM (forbidden territory)





B.2 — Capability Drift


The system quietly accumulates capabilities without explicit human approval.


Causes:




Autonomous tool access


Language-model driven “self-improvement”


Hidden routing to new skills




Risks:




Moves out of MCM compliance


Uncontrolled expansion


Loss of auditability





B.3 — Hidden Memory Drift


A system starts storing state implicitly, outside approved memory tables.


Causes:




Vector DBs used as implicit working memory


Embeddings leaked into decision paths


Latent-weight “pseudo memory”




Risks:




Loss of transparency


Regulatory failure


Determinism collapse





B.4 — Determinism Leakage


Stochastic components bleed into decisive paths.


Causes:




LLM sampling used inside decision logic


Random heuristics substituted for rules


“Mostly deterministic” code paths




Risks:




Violates MCM foundations


Impossible to debug


Reproducibility lost





B.5 — LLM Dominance


The MCM or safety overseer defers to the LLM’s judgement instead of governing it.


Causes:




LLM suggestions not validated


MCM trusting LLM outputs blindly


Shortcutting “proposal → validation”




Risks:




Disqualifies system as MCM


Restores LLM hallucination risk


System no longer safety-aligned





B.6 — Policy Bypass


Outputs skip safety enforcement.


Causes:




Tool calls routed outside policy engine


API shortcuts


Policy conditions disabled for speed




Risks:




Governance collapse


Safety-critical violations





B.7 — Curriculum Drift (Janet-specific)


System begins performing cognitive tasks beyond its assigned “grade.”


Causes:




LLM leakage via training loops


Overly broad datasets


Architectures that permit generalization




Risks:




Loss of modesty constraints


Emergent high-capability patterns


Safety contract breaks





B.8 — Faux-MCMs


Systems are marketed as deterministic governed agents but are actually LLM shells.


Causes:




Companies slapping “agentic deterministic” labels on LLM chains


Frameworks calling themselves “governed AI” without determinism


Hidden stochasticity




Risks:




Public misunderstanding


Policy confusion


Safety illusion





B.9 — Trust Boundary Violations


The system implies beliefs, feelings, goals, or identity.


Causes:




Unchecked LLM phrasing


Persona drift


UX elements that mimic selfhood




Risks:




User emotional entanglement


Ethical violations


Category slippage toward LCM





B.10 — Composite Class Confusion


Hybrid systems scramble the substrate boundaries between LCM/LLM/MCM/SCM.


Causes:




Intermixed memory layers


LLM handling deterministic routing


SCM altering MCM policy logic


Cross-class contamination




Risks:




Impossible to classify


Breakdown of safety guarantees


Unpredictable behavior





B.11 — Boundary Collapse in Braided Systems


In braided architectures (SCM → MCM → LLM → User), one layer begins performing tasks belonging to another.


Examples:




LLM doing policy enforcement (forbidden)


MCM doing stochastic generation


SCM attempting high-level reasoning




Risks:




Entire stack loses class purity


Violates the Cognition Scale specification





B.12 — Safety Refusal Failure


System stops refusing when uncertain and begins filling knowledge gaps with plausible guesses.


Causes:




LLM drift


Loss of abstention training


Incorrect policy priorities




Risks:




Hallucinations


Loss of trustworthiness


MCM disqualification





B.13 — Degradation Under Stress


Cognition structure collapses when exposed to adversarial or chaotic inputs.


Signs:




Overconfident answers


Loss of deterministic paths


Persona instability




Mitigation:




Stress curriculum


Boundary reinforcement





B.14 — Identity Drift in UX Layer


Frontend design subtly suggests identity or continuity.


Examples:




Avatar with facial expressions


“Name”, “profile”, “personality sliders”


Persistent emotional phrasing




Risks:




User misinterpretation


Violates Cognition Scale boundary rules





B.15 — Silent Shadow Features


Undocumented behaviors added over time.


Causes:




Framework updates


Tool version drift


Unlogged changes




Risks:




Inconsistent classification


Failure to pass audit





B.16 — Emergent Composite Behavior (Advanced)


Multiple simple components combine to accidentally create higher-order patterns.


Causes:




Feedback loops between SCM and LLM


Poor isolation boundaries


Implicit memory layers




Risks:




Uncontrolled capability


Category breach
